//Decrypter using LetterFrequency

/*
 This class decrypts a file using letter frequencies. 
 After getting the most frequent 4 letters in the encrypted file,
 it replaces these letters with the 4 most frequent letters 
 in the English texts, which are 'E', 'T', 'A', and 'O'.
 Since, say, the most frequent letter in the encrypted file
 does not have to be the encrypted letter of 'E', this class
 tries to decrypt using permutations of these 4 letters.
 Hence, it assumes 'E', 'T', 'A', and 'O' are the most frequent
 4 letters - without having to be in this order so it creates
 4! = 24 possible files - in the non-encrypted original plaintext.
 Then, the user can find out which of the 24 partially decrypted
 files actually corresponds to the non-encrypted original plaintext.
